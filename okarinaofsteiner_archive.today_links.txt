"In the most recent version, we can see that
1. The Non-East Eurasian component of Aeta/PH Negritos is modeled as Leang Panninge.
2. Non-Igorot Filipinos and Koreans are modeled as having a little Jomon (but not Taiwanese aborigines).
3. The Non-East Eurasian component in Wallaceans is modeled as Papuan/Australian aborigine-like. A good chunk of the East Eurasian ancestry in many Wallaceans is Austroasiatic-like, certainly more than in Filipinos.
4. Malay, Lao, and Siamese have both Simulated_AASI and IRN_Shahr-i-Sokhta. Cambodian and Khmer only seem to have the first one.
5. The Non-East Eurasian component of MY Negritos is mostly Hoabinhian-like and Simulated_AASI-like, but is also modeled with some Leang Panninge and Papuan-like component.
6. The South Asian groups that have Afanesievo also have Steppe_MBLA
7. The West-East cline for Chokhopani vs Upper_YR_LN among Himalayan-speaking groups in Mainland SEA is interesting.
8. Mongolic groups in China have a lot of Himalayan (Sinitic-related) ancestry"
