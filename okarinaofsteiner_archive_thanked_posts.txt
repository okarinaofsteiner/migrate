"Around 40 percent of the boy's mitochondria matched that from his
mother's father, and only 60 percent came from his grandmother.

After testing of other members of the same family, and other families
with mitochondrial diseases, Luo found that, while paternal
inheritance is very rare, it has occurred at least 17 times in three
tested families." Source: https://archive.ph/TkdZZ

(https://archive.ph/2CpKd) why I prefer Anthrogenica to other pop
anthro communities
"One of the biggest that I hear that gets thrown around a lot is this
idea that "Pakistanis" and "north Indians"(not just Muslims) are
heavily admixed with Persians, Arabs, Central Asians, and basically
any group that is even marginally connected to South Asian history.

Another is that South Indians, or Indians generally speaking are
closely related to Australian aborigines. Another very common belief
that unfortunately is prevalent even in anthro forums."
